We strive for every single flavor to taste true to their name. After months of extensive research and experimentation, the \"Cruff\" was born.\n\nWhat is a Cruff and why that name?\nCRUFF: [kr-uff] noun\n- A perfectly toasted, glazed donut stuffed with your ice cream flavor & toppings of choice.\n\n \"Woah, that Cruff looks almost too good to eat!\"\n\nPlace of origin: Brooklyn, NY\nCombination of (Cr)eam from ice cream + St(uff)ed\n\nStuffed Ice Cream isn't like your typical dessert shop, we believe in work hard, play hard, with both of them going hand in hand at any given time of the day. We like to bring the same comedic energy we hold during our everyday lives to both our customers and staff.\nWithout you, we got nothing to scoop for."
